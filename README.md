This is a small application built using pyforms and tkinter. The goal of this application is to randomly generate new player and store setup for the Millennium Blades board game. Python and pyforms were chosen in order to get the application completed as quickly as possible and in time I may turn this into a mobile app but I'm starting with desktop first. This should run on any system running python3.
